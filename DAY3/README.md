1. Introduction to Node.js
ðŸŒŸ What is Node.js?
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment.
It allows you to run JavaScript code outside a web browser, mainly on the server side.
Built on Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript Engine (very fast engine).
Run the JavaScript Code outside the Browser.



2. Key Features of Node.js
a. Asynchronous and Event-Driven
   ->Node.js uses a non-blocking I/O model.
   ->It can handle many requests at the same time without waiting for one to finish before starting another.


b. Single-Threaded but Highly Scalable
    -> It uses a single thread with an event loop.
    -> It can manage thousands of connections without creating new threads.


c. Very Fast
     -> Built on the V8 engine â†’ Compiles JavaScript to machine code.


d. Cross-Platform
    -> Works on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.




3. Where Node.js is Used?
Web servers and APIs
Real-time applications (like chat apps, games)
Streaming apps (like Netflix)
Microservices
Command-line tools



4. Understanding the Event Loop.
   What is the Event Loop?
       -> The Event Loop is the heart of Node.js.
       -> It allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations (like reading files, talking to databases) even though it runs on a single thread.
       -> It handles multiple operations without waiting for any one of them to finish.

    Why is the Event Loop Powerful?
      -> Handles thousands of requests at once without creating thousands of threads.
      -> Efficient for real-time apps (chat apps, live updates, multiplayer games).
      -> Fast and memory-efficient.



Shorthand:- 
Concept             | Meaning
Event Loop         | A mechanism that helps Node.js handle many operations without blocking
Single Thread     | Node.js uses one thread for executing JavaScript code
Non-blocking      | Node.js doesn't wait for operations to complete
Async Prog.        | Code continues executing without waiting




Node.js Architecture[Sync and Async Function ]
========================================
Architecture of Node js
=========================================
Two Functions:- [Blocking Operation means Sync ] & [Non Blocking Operation means Async]


Non Blocking Operation means Async[Event loop Check which type of Operation]
User sent the request , then request go to the Event Queue and from the event queue access the request by the event loop(it is a machine, it will watch on the event queue if a request is coming then it will pick up the request based on the FIFO principle, which user sent the request first) and process and respond to the user.
â€”--------------------------------------------

Blocking Operation means Sync[Event loop Check which type of Operation]
:- User sent the request , the request go to the thread pool where all thread will store , if we are sending the request then request means(thread means as a worker) then thread is responsible for the fulfil the operation.[If we have Thread/worker is available then we will give the work to worker after completing of the work it will response to the use ].
IDEA:- If we have 4 worker is there and we sent the request the 5 request by user then starting 4 request is take by the worker and 5th request handle after completing of the any request suppose 1st worker is free firstly then handle 5th request.


For Example[S]:- If we are Creating the web application /server then in the website n number of users is coming and our code is written through blocking  operation then that is not a better way to use blocking operation please always use the unblocking operation(Async).


                                        request queue            request loop
 Non Blocking :- request -----------> |----------------| ------> 1, 2,3,4    ----> response
                                      |_1__2___3__4____|


                      I need a thread/worker    _____________
 Blocking Operation -------------------------->|Thread Pool |
                     Assign a worker and make  |            |
                      him work                 |            |
                                               |____________|
    <-----------------------------------------<|
          return the result




====================================================================



Rough Work:- 



inside the browser
outside the browser : nodejs


Node js : 
Open source 
run time enviornment 
js code outside the broswer 
chrome v8 JavaScript engine



Node js :- 
Key features :- 
1. Asynchronous :- node js use non-blocking model 
   it can handle n number same time handle on finish 
2. single threaded - execution single thread 
3. very fast :- v8 chrome -> compile js code into machine code 
4. cross platfrom :- it can run on various operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux


where we use  nodejs 

1. web server and API (Application programming interface)
2. realtime appilcatiion(like chatapp , games)
3. streaming app(netflix)
4. command line tools 
<!-- ================================================== -->

Installing nodejs

<!-- ========================================= -->

Event Loop :- heart of nodejs
allow nodejs to perform non-blocking i/o [Asychronous operation] like reading file , talking to database ) it runs on the single thread.

-> it handle multiple operation without waiting for any of them to finish

why event loop powerful :- 
:- handled thousands of req without creating of thousand  thread
:- efficinet real time app chat app , multiplayer games 
:- fast and memory- efficient

for 

Event-loop :-A mechanism  that helps nodejs handle many operation without blocking .

Single Thread :- Nodejs uses one thread for executing js code

Non-blocking :- Node js doesn't wait for operation to complete

Aysnc Prog. :- code continues exeecuting without waiting 


<!-- ============================================= -->

Node js Architecture
[sync and Async ]

Tow function :- Blocking operation means sync
                 Non blocking means Async

Non blocking means Async :- 


<!-- ======================================= -->


Module  : import export 
module is file in nodejs
it contains code(function ,variables, classes) tha we can reuse
help clean or organized 

Type of module :- 

provide by nodejs 
fs(file system), http, path 

third party module :-
express

let demo = require("fs")
